# MultiModalDistance
Provides distance matrices of letter confusion for the Latin alphabet from papers compared by Müller & Weidemann (2011) and deducted from Wiley et al (2016) for Farsi.
Additionally, for acoustics via letters, phoneme-grapheme mappings for English, French, Finnish and Farsi. 

# Files
- 2 zip files, one for distance matrices as extracted from the papers, one for farsi
